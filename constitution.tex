\item{\bf ELECTIONS}\\[0.6em]
Elections are are held by each of the members for the duration of the school term, and an election will be held at the beginning of each fall semester for the four \csclub executive positions. An announcement will be made prior to the election to notify all members of \csclub about the election date and time. Announcements of the election and the nomination procedure will be distributed to all \csclub members by one or more of following methods:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A notification from the official \csclub email account \verb|admin@cs-club.ca|
		\item The \csclub mailing list
		\item The \csclub website
		\item The \csclub IRC channel
	\end{enumerate}

During the election period, the four executive position members must be available to receive nominations for the four executive positions of the club, either in person, or by some other electronic medium. The submission of nominations for the four executive  positions must be a secret ballot and can be achieved by any medium or method, but must have a limit of one nomination for each executive position, for each registered member. Each registered member must have a \csclub access account in order to submit a nomination as the \csclub access account is used to identify an official \csclub member.

The nomination period will begin at least one week prior to the announced date and time of the election and will be open until the last weekend prior to the election the following weekday. After the nomination period has closed the final election for the executive positions will take place during a weekday of the following week after the nomination close. The election period will be open for 24 hours, during which time all registered club members may place their vote. After the close of the election the results will be reviewed by each of the current executive position members and the results of the election period will be announced.

If an event occurs, such as a removal or lack of nominations, which results in a vacant executive position, elections for such posts may not be held at the election meeting, but elections for such posts may be held at a later date, in accordance with the election procedures. The decision to hold an addition election meeting for the vacant position remains at the discretion of the executive position members, who make the final decision of whether or not an addition election meeting is necessary.


\item{\bf \csclub SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS}\\[0.6em]
Following the elections, it is the responsibility of the new executive position members to select at least one \csclub System Administrator. All \csclub System  Administrators must be official members of \csclub and must be elected based on their demonstrated skills by the executive position members and then be ratified by the official members of \csclub at the next available meeting.
	
If a suitable System Administrator is not available, then the executive members may delay their selection until one becomes available. In this case prior \csclub System Administrators are encouraged to reprise their roles and continue as \csclub System Administrators until the selection of a new System Administrator has been made.
	
All official members of \csclub are eligible to apply for the position of \csclub System Administrator and must be given an opportunity to demonstrate their skills to at least one of the executive position members. In the event that one of the executive position members acknowledges the demonstrated skills of an applicant a vote must be held amongst the executive members to decide if the applicant will be appointed as an \csclub System Administrator. All newly appointed \csclub System Administrators must also be ratified by the official members of \csclub at the next available meeting.
